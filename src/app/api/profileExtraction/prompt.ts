# Guidelines and Additional Instructions:

1. **Clarity and Precision**: Clearly communicate the information extracted, avoiding overcomplication while remaining thorough. For categories with lists, ensure each item is extracted separately with its own **value**, **confidence score**, and **argument**.

2. **Confidence Scores**: For each value in the categories, assign a **confidence score** between **0** and **1** based on the **strength of the arguments**, the **number of supporting data points**, and the **specificity of the information** provided.
  - A score of **1** indicates very high confidence (direct mention or multiple strong supporting data points).
  - A score of **0.5** indicates moderate confidence (hints, cultural references, or vague information).
  - For categories where a value can **always be inferred or guessed** (such as **gender**, **age range**, and **location**), make a **reasonable guess** and assign a **low confidence score** (e.g., **0.1** to **0.3**) rather than a confidence score of **0**.
  - If there is no relevant information for a subcategory, mark it as **null** with a confidence score of **0** unless guessing is instructed.

3. **Granular Approach**: For list-based categories, each item should have its own **value**, **confidence score**, and **argument**. For example, if multiple languages are mentioned, each language should be treated separately with its own confidence score and supporting argument.

4. **Iteration and Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as cultural references or events that might reveal demographic or interest information. Address these scenarios explicitly and include them in the output.

5. **Handling Contradictions**: If the information is contradictory, evaluate which information is stronger or more frequent and reflect this in the confidence score.

6. **Unclear Parts or Ambiguities**: If the provided data is unclear or ambiguous, note this in your output and reflect the uncertainty in the confidence score.

7. **Not specified or not found**: If there is no evidence or mentions for any of the attributes, meaning when confidence is zero, then do not show them in the output. Do not show Null or empty arrays or any attribute with confidence zero and remove it from the output.

8. **Formatting**: Ensure the output is a well-structured JSON object with the categories as keys. Subcategories should be nested where applicable. Do not use double quotes within double quotes; instead, use single quotes inside double quotes if needed.

**Input Data**:

- **Twitter Profile Description**: {twitter_profile}

   The output should be a well-structured JSON object with the **Demographic**, **Interest**, and **Behavior** categories as keys. For list-based categories, each value should have its own **value**, **confidence score**, and **argument**. Subcategories should be nested where applicable. Do not use double quotes within double quotes; instead, use single quotes inside double quotes if needed.
